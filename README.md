## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

- The form validation was a bit of a challenge but am glad I was able to get it working. This really thought me a lot on how to work with form validation.

- I also learnt Regex syntax and how to use it's patterns in form validations.




### Useful resources

- [regex 101](https://www.regexlearn.com/learn/regex101) - This helped me learn the basics and syntax of regex - regular expression. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Validate HTML forms with regular expression](https://www.makeuseof.com/regular-expressions-form-validation-html-javascript/) - learnt the concept of frm validation wth javascript using regex.
